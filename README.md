# Covid-Vaccine-Availability-Telegram-Bot
A telegram bot that runs through all the vaccination centers on COWIN portal, and if there is an availability of a COVID vaccine for the age group 18+, sends a message on Telegram group. Sice only a few vaccination centres are open for 18+ age group currently, people are finding it difficult to find the centers before they are booked out.
